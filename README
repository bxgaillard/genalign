GenAlign: A Gene Alignment Program


This program can be used to align two strings, for example two genes.  It finds
the less expensive way to align them according to cost tables representinf the
cost for each operation (insertion, deletion, substitution), for each character
of the strings.

The program can load FASTA and GenBank flat files for loading a gene from an
existing file.  It can also generate a random gene and generate the second one
by applying random alterations on the first one.

This application has been developed using JBuilder.  Sources are standard Java
buy the frame is designed with more ease using JBuilder.  Note: JBuilder version
2005 was used.


Organization of the classes:
    * Aligner.java: the alignment algorithm lies here.
    * Application.java: main application class which opens the main frame.
    * Costs.java: used to centralize cost information from editable tables.
    * CostTable1D.java: a generator for an editable 1D cost table.
    * CostTable2D.java: a generator for an editable 2D cost table.
    * ExtFileFilter.java: a file filter for opening FASTA/GenBank gene files.
    * MainFrame.java: the main window (frame).
    * MainFrame.jbx: jBuilder file for the main frame.


To build the application:
    make

To launch it:
    make run


Have fun! :]
